# Carelify-ImageClassification
These are the files for training ImageClassification using pre-trained model and fine tuning from Keras, and after running all the codes from Xception.ipynd, you would receive 1. fine tuned model (.h5) 2. Accuracy and Loss graphs (both before and after fine tuning) 3. (Statistics, Matrix, and Heatmap)
